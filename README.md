# Computer Architecture 
All homeworks and projects learned and developed throughout Fall Semester of 2020
* _Course Description_
  * Introduces the concepts of computer architecture by going through multiple levels of abstraction, and the numbering systems and their basic computations. It focuses on the instruction-set architecture of the MIPS machine, including MIPS assembly programming, translation between MIPS and C, and between MIPS and machine code. General topics include performance calculation, processor datapath, pipelining, and memory hierarchy.
